# 🏆 Thank you!
We truly stand on the shoulders of giants and this project would not have been even remotely feasible without them. An especially huge thank you to
* The authors and contributors of Tantivy for providing the inverted index library on which Cuely is built.
* The commoncrawl organization for crawling the web and making the dataset readily available.
